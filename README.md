# FastReco
FastHadronReco.cc implements fast hadron reconstruction in sPHENIX, including track selection, vertexing, calorimeter matching, QA histograms, and output ntuples. It is based on and adapted from the KshortReconstruction.cc code originally developed by Anthony Frawley, with extensions for hadron analysis.
